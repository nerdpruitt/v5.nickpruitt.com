            <p>As evidenced by the giant, jumbled letters above, my name is Nick Pruitt. I have fixed browser bugs in Internet Explorer 6. I have created open source Sass libraries and JavaScript plugins. I have built Single Page Web Apps. Really Iâ€™ve just done this front-end web development thang long enough (and lost enough hair) to have seen a little bit of everything.</p>
